Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

*Memories from childhood*

1. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
2. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
3. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. I'm trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What?! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

You mean it controls your actions? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
